        Hey there,
        
        This place is for asking genuine open-ended questions and receiving answers to them.
        This is **not** a place for opinions, feature requests or opinions and feature requests _pretending_ to be questions.
        This is _also_ **not** a place to receive emotional support.
        
        **Don't:**
        - ask things that are already covered extensively by the docs on https://NoCloud.cloud
        - ask things you already know the answer to but
          - want things to be different
          - need someone else to tell you the same answer again so that
            - you will believe it
            - they can be made responsible for your emotions
        - ask questions with a hidden agenda
        - "ask" questions that are just statements
        - ask for general linux support and step-by-step handholding
        - bargain

        For more information on feature requests see here: [New Issue: Feature request](https://github.com/UnKn0wn/NoCloud/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&projects=&template=feature_request.yml)
        And for asking if a robot is or could be supported see here: [New Issue: Robot support request](https://github.com/UnKn0wn/NoCloud/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&projects=&template=pls_support_robot.yml)
