## Home Assistant Integration

The main platform you'll probably be using NoCloud with is Home Assistant.

### Connecting NoCloud to Home Assistant

NoCloud connects to Home Assistant via MQTT + the MQTT Autodiscovery Feature of Home Assistant.
This means that to connect NoCloud to Home Assistant, you will need an MQTT broker on your network

For this, Mosquitto is the recommended choice. It is available in every relevant linux distribution, can be dockered
and can also be installed as a HAOS Add-On if you run the appliance version of HA.

It also has barely any resource footprint, meaning that there's nothing to worry about if you just run it for NoCloud.
Even more so, considering that it definitely won't stay like that for long. Smarthome is a _very_ slippery slope. :)

<br/>

However you deploy the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, once deployed, you just point both Home Assistant and NoCloud at the same
broker and then automagically a new Device + its Entities will appear in Home Assistant. 

If it does not appear, make sure to check the Logs in HA, the Broker and also NoCloud.
Usually, it's a network-related or ACL issue.

Also, keep in mind that MQTT Autodiscovery will **not** create a "New devices discovered on your network" notification in Home Assistant.
The new NoCloud Device will just be there.

### Building Dashboards with NoCloud

If you'd like to use the NoCloud Iconset as part of your Dashboards, check out this repository:
[https://github.com/DGAlexandru/hass-NoCloud-icons](https://github.com/DGAlexandru/hass-NoCloud-icons)

To display the map of your robot in a Home Assistant dashboard, the [NoCloud Map Card](https://github.com/DGAlexandru/lovelace-NoCloud-map-card) is used.
Setup instructions for that can be found on [hass.valetudo.cloud](https://hass.valetudo.cloud/).

### Interacting with NoCloud

Basic interaction with NoCloud is done via the autodiscovered entities.
They will allow you to observe state, toggle settings, trigger the auto-empty feature, start full cleanups and all that.

For more sophisticated use-cases like e.g. cleaning specific segments, the `mqtt.publish` action is used.

To determine the right payloads for your specific setup, in the NoCloud UI, simply configure/select the segments/zones/go-to locations
like you'd normally do and then long-press the button that would start the action.
This will bring up a dialog providing you with everything you'll need:

To determine the right topic to publish that payload to, first determine the `base topic` by visiting `Connectivity - MQTT Connectivity` in the NoCloud UI:

![ha-demo-base-topic.png](./img/ha-demo-base-topic.png)

Then, look up the rest of the topic + any other considerations for the desired Capability in the [MQTT documentation](/pages/integrations/mqtt.html).

For the example in these screenshots, the full service call would look like this:

```
action: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: NoCloud/InsecureYellowishGoldfish/MapSegmentationCapability/clean/set
  payload: '{"action":"start_segment_action","segment_ids":["3","2","5"],"iterations":2,"customOrder":true}'
```
