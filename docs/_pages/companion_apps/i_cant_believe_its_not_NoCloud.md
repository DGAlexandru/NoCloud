# I Can't Believe It's Not NoCloud

A companion microservice, which is meant to be run on another host to draw PNG images from the NoCloud Map Data, which are then
published back to MQTT as well.

Useful for stuff like e.g. using home automation software to send a notification including the latest map image or if you're using FHEM or ioBroker.
